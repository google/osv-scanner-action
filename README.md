# OSV-Scanner Github Action

OSV-Scanner is offered as a GitHub Action. We currently have two different GitHub Actions:

1. An action that triggers a scan with each pull request and will only check for new vulnerabilities introduced through the pull request.
2. An action that performs a single vulnerability scan, which can be configured to scan on a regular schedule, or used as a check on releases to prevent releasing with known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
